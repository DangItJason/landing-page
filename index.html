                <div class="content-section">
                    <p>EmiCare was born from lived experience. Our team consists of current and former caregivers who have walked this difficult path and understand the daily reality of caring for loved ones.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>To empower caregivers with intelligent tools that reduce stress, improve care outcomes, and preserve the human connection that makes caregiving meaningful.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why We Built Emi</h3>
                    <p>Traditional healthcare technology wasn't designed for the complex, emotional reality of family caregiving. We've experienced firsthand the frustration of juggling multiple apps, paper records, and endless phone calls while trying to provide the best care possible.</p>
                    
                    <p>Emi is different because it's built by people who get it. We understand that 3 AM medication questions can't wait, that coordinating care across multiple providers is exhausting, and that sometimes you just need someone to tell you that you're doing a good job.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Coming Q4 2025</h3>
                    <p>We're currently in development, working closely with caregivers to ensure Emi meets real needs. Join our early access program to be among the first to experience a caregiving copilot that truly understands.</p>
