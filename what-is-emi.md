# What is Emi?

## The Truth About Caregiving in America

You're managing medication schedules at 3 AM while your loved one sleeps fitfully. Your phone buzzes with appointment reminders you forgot to set. The insurance company wants forms you can't find. Your boss keeps asking when you'll be "back to normal." Meanwhile, you haven't slept through the night in months, and that crushing weight in your chest grows heavier each day.

This is caregiving in America. Not the sanitized version you see in commercials with smiling families and gentle piano music. The real version where 53 million Americans are drowning in a system that expects miracles from exhausted people. Where you're supposed to become a medical expert, insurance navigator, and emotional support system overnight – all while pretending your own life isn't falling apart.

**Caregiving is f***ing hard.** And anyone who tells you otherwise has never spent their lunch break on hold with Medicare while their parent forgets to eat lunch again.

## Meet Emi: Your AI Caregiver Copilot

Emi isn't another app promising to "simplify" your life with more notifications. She's your personal AI caregiver copilot – built by people who've been exactly where you are right now. People who've missed their kid's soccer game because of an emergency room visit. Who've cried in hospital parking lots. Who know that "self-care" feels like a cruel joke when you're running on coffee and pure determination.

Emi transforms the chaos into a system that actually works. Not by adding more to your plate, but by becoming the brain you can't spare and the support system you desperately need.

## How Emi Changes Everything

### She Remembers So You Don't Have To

Your brain is already maxed out. Emi handles the mental load – tracking medications, remembering what the doctor said last Tuesday, knowing which pharmacy has the prescription ready. She creates order from the chaos swirling in your head.

### She Speaks Healthcare Fluency

Insurance denials written in medical hieroglyphics? Emi translates. Doctor's notes that might as well be in ancient Greek? She breaks it down. That pile of paperwork staring at you from the kitchen counter? She knows exactly what each form means and what you need to do next.

### She Plans Ahead So You Can Breathe

Emi doesn't just react to crises – she prevents them. She spots patterns in symptoms before they become emergencies. She reminds you about prescription refills before you're scrambling at midnight. She helps you prepare for appointments so you walk in confident instead of frazzled.

### She Connects You With Real Help

When you need human support, Emi knows exactly who to connect you with. The right specialist for your specific situation. Support groups where people actually understand. Resources in your area that don't require a PhD to navigate.

## Built for the Reality of Caregiving

Emi understands that caregiving happens in stolen moments between everything else. She works while you're commuting, sleeping, or finally taking that shower you've been putting off for three days. She's there at 2 AM when anxiety hits and you need someone who gets it.

This isn't about replacing human connection – it's about giving you the support and systems you need to show up fully for the people and moments that matter most.

**Because you shouldn't have to choose between taking care of someone you love and taking care of yourself.**

## Coming Q4 2025

Emi launches this fall, designed specifically for caregivers who need more than another app – they need a copilot who understands that caregiving isn't just hard work, it's heart work.
